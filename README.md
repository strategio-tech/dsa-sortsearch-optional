# DSA Assignment: Sorting & Searching (OPTIONAL)

Accepting the GitHub Assignment will create a repo with a series of challenges at `/src/main/java/tech.strategio` and its corresponding unit tests at `/src/test/java/tech.strategio`.

Each exercise contains a class with a method. Complete the methods in an IDE such that the unit tests pass. You should run your unit tests often, either through your Java IDE or through the command line (`gradle test`).

To submit the exercises, push a commit to GitHub. Automated tests will run, and youâ€™ll see a green checkbox if ALL unit tests pass.

## Assignments

### E01 - Sort the array using the Bubble Sort Algorithm.

*OPTIONAL, Difficulty rating: Easy*

Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns a sorted version of that array. Use the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort the array. 


- Optimal Space & Time Complexity

  - Best: O(n) time | O(1) space - where n is the length of the input array
  - Average: O(n^2) time | O(1) space - where n is the length of the input array
  - Worst: O(n^2) time | O(1) space - where n is the length of the input array

Sample Input
```
array = [141, 1, 17, -7, -17, -27]
```

Sample Output
```
[-27, -17, -7, 1, 17, 141]
```

## Hints


<details>
  <summary>Hint</summary>
  
   Traverse the input array, swapping any two numbers that are out of order and keeping track of any swaps that you make. 
   
   Once you arrive at the end of the array, check if you have made any swaps; if not, the array is sorted and you are done; otherwise, repeat the steps laid out in this hint until the array is sorted.
